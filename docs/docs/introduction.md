# Introduction

### Hey! üëãüèø

Welcome to your beginner-friendly [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) workshop.

The goal of this workshop is to get you familiar with how *Flutter* applications are built. It is quite simple and easy
to follow along with code blocks at every step of the way.

In this workshop, you would build a simple inventory or collection of tasty wines. You would design the entire interface
from scratch.

You would even go as far building a sortable rating system and a search bar to spicy it up.

To get a glimpse of what you would build, see screenshots below.

<div>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/screenshots/01.png" /></td>
      <td><img src="/screenshots/02.png" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/screenshots/03.png" /></td>
      <td><img src="/screenshots/04.png" /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

The entire source code for this application is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/codecentricnl/flutter_basic_workshop.git).

## What is Flutter

Flutter is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications
from a single codebase. See [Showcase](https://flutter.dev/showcase)

## Prerequisites

*Flutter* applications are built using a programming language called [Dart](https://dart.dev). Not to worry, it is not a
difficult language to work with. Think of it like a hybrid consisting of either of the following languages Javascript,
Typescript, Java and C#. So if you have coded in any of those, this should be a breeze.

Also, since you are already reading this, the IDE of choice would be this browser, yes, this browser.

We would be utilizing a hosted version of the *Flutter* SDK called [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev).
This means you do not need to install anything locally on your machine if you do not want to but if you do not mind, you
could also have the SDK installed locally and follow along as well. Same code applies both ways.
